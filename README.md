# Appreciation
Sample paper-less app to celebrate appreciation day

Have you ever played a game of anonymously sending appreciation notes/messages to your colleagues, associates, friends and family members?Who doesn't like being appreciated?

In our office too, every February we celebrate different fun days. One day we celebrate is Appreciation Day, wherein any employee can write appreciation note for any other employee in a sticky note and then stick it to his/her desk/work-place.

I thought of making this wonderful excerise paperless.

This project is simple MVC app that asks to fill up appreciation form and display them on the go. The app has the flexibility of whether to show name of appreciator or not.



<h2>Form to fill with option of whether to show or hide name of poster:</h2>
